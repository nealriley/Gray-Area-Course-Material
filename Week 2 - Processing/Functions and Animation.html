In this assignment you will write a program with an animation. The animation is created 
by drawing the same shape or shapes
over and over again. Each time the shape is drawn, some aspect will change. In the example above,
it's size, position and color change slightly every time the screen is drawn.
You may use any drawing function that you would like, your animation does not have to
look like the one above. You may find this example of a <a href="https://6d1a107dca32a981f78f66426e9b7bd23b9efcb5.googledrive.com/host/0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTY1VNdkhxajZCekk/PatternsOfShapes/SimpleAnimation.html">Simple Animation</a>
helpful.
<ul><b>Program Requirements</b>
<li>Your program will need variables for each aspect of the shape that changes
</li><li>It will need at least two functions <code>void setup()</code> and <code>void draw()</code>. 

</li></ul>

<ul><b>Optional</b>
<li>You might try putting <code>smooth()</code> in <code>setup()</code>
</li><li>A little opacity in combination with <code>smooth()</code> can achieve some surprising results
</li><li>You may want to include an <code>if</code> statement, so that if your shape gets too big, 
you can erase the screen and set the variables back to their initial values.
</li><li>You may want to use the <code>frameRate()</code> function to adjust how quickly the screen is drawn. 
</li></ul>
