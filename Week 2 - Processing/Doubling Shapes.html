<p>This assignment is similiar to the previous one, except now the number of shapes
doubles. Each time the screen is redrawn,
there will be twice as many shapes drawn as before. 




 
</p><h3>Steps to completing this assignment</h3>

<ol><li>You can use your previous program as a starting point.

</li><li>Find the control expression for your loop. It's what's inside the parenthesis after <code>while</code>
 and it's the part of the loop that controls how many times it runs. Instead of using the literal 100 we are going to
replace it with a variable.

</li><li>Declare the variable near the beginning of the program and initialize it to 1 in the setup() function. 
 Run your program and verify that you are seeing one shape each time the screen is drawn.

</li><li>You should display the variable to the screen to make sure your program is producing the right number of shapes.
You can read about Processing Fonts in the API.

</li><li>Now, add code to double the variable after the loop so that the next time the screen is drawn,
the loop will run twice as many times.

</li><li>You should also use an <code>if</code> statement to reset the variable to one if it gets too big.



</li><li>Don't forget to put your name, class and assignment in comments in the beginning of the file.

</li></ol>
