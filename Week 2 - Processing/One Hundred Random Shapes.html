<p>Your assignment is to write a program that uses a loop to draw 
100 random shapes to the screen. Each time the screen is redrawn,
the shapes will have some random difference. It could be location, color, size, opacity, or whatever. Your program
may use 2d or 3d graphics. Your
program doesn't have to look like mine above, it's exact appearence is entirely up to you. If you want,
you could number each shape to show that there really are 100 shapes
on the screen. Have fun and be creative! 




 
</p><h3>Steps to completing this assignment</h3>

<ol><li>Start a new program in Processing. <b>Do not name your program <code>100Shapes</code> or any name
that starts with a number. <i>Java does not allow program names to start with anything other than a letter of
the alphabet.</i></b>
</li><li>Write <code>void setup()</code> and <code>void draw()</code> functions. 
</li><li>In <code>draw()</code>, write a loop that runs 100 times. Inside that loop place your code that generates
one random shape.
</li><li>If you are using 3d graphics be sure to translate <b>back</b> after you draw your shape. For instance, my code
looked like:
<pre><code>
  translate(xOffset,yOffset,zOffset);
  box(50);
  translate(-xOffset,-yOffset,-zOffset);
</code></pre>
where <code>xOffset,yOffset, zOffset</code> and <code>randomSize</code> are <b>variables
that I declared</b> and assigned random values. 
<p>Note: to keep your shapes from being translated outside the viewable
region, have the <code>zOffset</code> be a random <i>negative</i> number. Translating in the negative z direction
pushes the shape "away from you."

</p></li><li>Don't forget to put your name, class and assignment in comments.
 </li></ol>
