<p>Your assignment is to write a program that moves something in a
random walk. Click on the penguin to see it move in a random walk. Your program doesn't have to look or work
like my example. Any sort of random walk is fine. Check the samples of student work at the bottom for some ideas.
Have fun and be creative!

<h3>Some examples from the "Real World"</h3>
<p>Programmers create software using random walks to help researchers model and study many real world phenomena. 
</p><ul><li>Here's an
<a href="http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/brownian.htm">applet that demonstrates Brownian Motion</a>, the
random movement (closely related to a random walk) of
particles suspended in a liquid or gas which was described by Einstein. 

</li><li>Here's another applet that shows
that a gambler will almost certainly lose all his money in the long run, a phenomena called 
<a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~carlson/teaching/java/prob/brownianmotion/4/index.html">Gambler's Ruin</a>.

</li><li><a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kardar/teaching/projects/chemotaxis(AndreaSchmidt)/random.htm">This applet
uses a random walk to simulate chemotaxis</a> which I think means "animals foraging for food"

</li><li>This applet uses a random walk to test different systems of 
<a href="http://www.hquotes.com/tradehard/simulator.html">investing in the stock market</a>.

<h3>Steps to completing this assignment</h3>

<ol>
<li>While you could use your picture from the penguin assignment,
you may find it easier to move a simpler object like an ellipse or a point
</li><li>You could also move an image, see the
<a href="http://processing.org/reference/image_.html">image() example</a> to get started.
</li><li>Once you've choosen what picture or object you want, make sure you can see it on the screen.
</li><li>Then make sure you can move your image or picture by changing it's x and y coordinates.
</li><li>Since the x and y coordinates of the picture or object will be changing, we will need <i>variables</i> for each
</li><li>In <code>void draw()</code>, change the variables that hold the x and y coordinates a small amount using <code>random</code>
