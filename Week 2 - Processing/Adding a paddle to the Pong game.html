<p>We're now ready to add a paddle to the pong game. 
</p><ol><li>Start by writing a Paddle <code>class</code>. It should have functions that <code>show()</code>
it to the screen and <code>move()</code> it to the left and right
</li><li>Create a <code>new Paddle()</code> and draw it to the screen
</li><li>Use an <code>if</code> statement in <code>draw()</code> to allow the user to move the paddle
</li><li>Modify the <code>bounce()</code> to use <code>get()</code> (like in the tron game) to see if the
ball is going to hit something that is not black.
</li></ol>


<h3>Extensions</h3>
Once you get the basics working, you can add extra features to your Pong Game. For example:
<ol><li>Change the size or color of the ball with each bounce
</li><li>Keep score
</li><li>Allow the user to move the paddle up and down as well as side to side
</li><li>Change the angle of the bounce to depend on the part of the paddle that the ball hits.
</li><li>Add "bricks" to make a Break-Out style game
</li><li>Add gravity to make a Rebound style game
</li><li>Add a second player or a computer opponent
</li><li>Make a Pong clock--lock at <a href="http://processing.org/reference/hour_.html">this processing clock</a> to get
ideas.
</li></ol>
Be creative, your Pong game doesn't have to look or work like any other.
