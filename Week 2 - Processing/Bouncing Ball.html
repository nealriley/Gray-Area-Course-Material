<h3>Background</h3>
This assignment is the first step in creating a single player Pong game. Pong was the first video game to
achieve commercial success. It was invented in 1972.  It's a little known fact that
the programmer who worked with Nolan Bushnell at Atari on Pong is a Lowell alumnus:  Allan Alcorn.   At first Pong was
only found in commercial arcades, but later in 1974 it achieved wide success as a home computer game.  The Pong game is
important historically as it was the first computer many people brought into their homes. It was the first human computer
interface many people experienced.  Computer Programmers use the term "killer app" to mean an important (killer)
application (program) that has wide appeal.  Many people will buy their first computer to run a particular "killer app" .
Pong was the "killer app" that helped to make home video games successful.  



<h3>Starting the Assignment</h3>
For this assignment, you will need to create your own <b><code>Ball</code></b> class. In designing a class, you
need to ask yourself, what do these objects <i>have</i> and what do they <i>do</i>.
For everything they <i>have</i> we'll create a variable and for everything they <i>do</i> we will create a function.
For our <b><code>Ball</code></b> we will need
<ul><li>two <code>int</code> variables for the x and y coordinates
</li><li>two <code>boolean</code> "direction" variables for that hold whether the ball is going up, and whether it is going to the right
</li><li><code>Ball()</code> (called a <i>constructor</i>) that will intialize those 4 variables, meaning <i>set them equal to their first values</i>
</li><li><code>void move()</code>	moves the ball in the current direction of travel
</li><li><code>void bounce()</code> changes the direction variables if the ball hits one side of the screen
</li><li><code>void show()</code>		draws a white circle with center (x,y)
</li></ul>



<h3><code>move()</code></h3>


<p>The <code>move()</code> function is pretty easy.  In move we check to see the the ball is going right, with code like
<code>if(right == true)</code>. If it is,
we increase <code>x</code> by 1 (or some other number), otherwise we decrease the <code>x</code> . 
Then we check to see if the ball is
going down.  If it is we increase <code>y</code>, otherwise we decrease <code>y</code> .

</p><h3><code>bounce()</code></h3>

<p>In <code>bounce()</code> we check to see if the ball has reached the edge of the screen.
If it has, we change it's direction by changing one of the <code>boolean</code> variables with code like
</p><pre> <code>
if(x &lt; 0)
{
   right = true;
} </code> </pre>

<h3><code>setup()</code> and <code>draw()</code> and the rest of the program</h3>
Creating a class is like writing a blueprint. You haven't actually
"made a ball" until you use the blueprint to build a <code><b>new Ball()</b></code>.
You will need to declare a <code><b>Ball</b></code> variable at the top of the program and initialize it
to be a <code><b>new Ball()</b></code> in
<code><b>setup()</b>. <b>draw()</b></code> will erase the screen and then <code><b>move()</b></code>,
<code><b>bounce()</b></code>, and
<code><b>show()</b></code> the Ball.

<p>Submit the URL of your applet along with your code (the <code><b>.pde</b></code> file(s)) via the school loop
drop box for the assignment.
