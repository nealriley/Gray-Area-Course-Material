In this assignment you will write a program that takes user input from the keyboard and mouse to allow the user
to interact with your program.
Your program doesn't need to appear the same
as the above example, check the links to sample student work below for ideas. Have fun and be creative. 
<ul><b>Program Requirements</b>
<li>Your finished program will need at least two functions <code>void setup()</code> and <code>void draw()</code>. 
</li><li>It will also need to respond to keyboard and mouse input. 
</li><li>There will have to be at least two <code>if</code> statements, one for the mouse and one for the keyboard.


</li></ul>

<h3>Optional--Put your program on an Android phone or tablet</h3>
Processing has an Android mode that makes it very easy to put your program on your phone or tablet. You'll need to make a few changes to your program though:
<ol><li>Don't use the <code>size()</code> function. Every phone and tablet has a different size screen. To find the size call <code>width</code> and/or <code>height</code>.
</li><li>On your Android device, go to <i>Settings | Security</i> and choose <i>Unknown sources - allow installation of non-Market apps</i>
</li><li>Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable. You may need to <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html">install the appropriate driver</a>.
</li><li>Start processing. Enable Android mode. Choose <i>Sketch | Run on device</i>. Processing should install the program and start it running on your phone or tablet.</li></ol>
<p>Note: If you want to do this at home, you'll need to install the Android SDK and the USB drivers for your phone. You can find instructions <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android">here</a>
