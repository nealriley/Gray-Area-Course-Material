<p>This assignment asks you to write an applet that replicates the classic Magic 8 Ball toy from the 1960’s.
Your program (like the original 8 Ball) will not really pay any attention to the user’s question—it will simply give
one of several "canned" answers.  The original Magic 8 Ball had these
answers printed on the sides of two eight sided dice. When it was turned upside down, the dice would float to the top
and one side of one die would be shown on the answer window. Here are the original 16 answers:  
<code>
</code></p><p><code>outlook not so good
<br>don't count on it
<br>my sources say no
<br>without a doubt
<br>reply hazy, try again
<br>it is certain
<br>my reply is no
<br>as I see it yes
<br>most likely
<br>you may rely on it
<br>cannot predict now	
<br>better not tell you now
<br>very doubtful
<br>outlook good	
<br>yes definitely
<br>concentrate and ask again

</code></p><p>You may use these answers or make up your own.


</p><h3>Arrays</h3>

<p>For this assignment you are required to use an array of strings to
store the answers.    You can declare and intialize an array of strings with code like:</p><pre><code>
String[] answers = {"yes", "no", "maybe" };</code></pre><br>
Remember that arrays in are zero based:  <br>
<code>println(answers[1]);</code> 
<br>would print <code>no</code>.

<h3>Program Requirements</h3>
<p><b>Don't name your program <code>8ball</code>!</b> Java doesn't allow names that start with digits. (If you do
name your program illegally, processing automatically puts an underscore in front of the name to make it legal,
but school loop won't accept files that begin with an underscore.)

</p><p>Your program will have two modes: an "answer" mode and a "question" mode. You will need a boolean to keep
track of which mode you are in.
