<h3>Background:</h3>
The Etch-A-Sketch is a plastic tablet that lets you make designs by turning knobs that control a point (called a stylus). The left and right knobs control horizontal and vertical rods, moving the stylus where the two rods meet. When the stylus moves, it scrapes the screen, which is coated with a mixture of aluminum powder and plastic beads, leaving the line you see. The first Etch-A-Sketch was sold in 1960. Through television advertising it went on to become one of the most popular toys ever made.

<p>In this assignment you will create an electronic version of the Etch-A-Sketch. This program will give you practice with <code>if</code> statements and keyboard input.

</p><p>Since this is a larger program than the previous assignments, you may want to complete it in steps.

</p><h3>Step One:</h3>
It is a good idea to start by writing the code that allows you to "draw". We can use the <code>point()</code> function
to draw one dot at a time on the screen. The function takes two integer arguments--the x and y coordinates of the point.

<p>Here is an outline of the basic program. Your job is to translate the outline into computer code.
You should then have a working program that will form the beginning of this assignment.

   </p><ol><li>Declare two integer variables for the X &amp; Y coordinates of the stylus and initialize them to the center of the screen
         </li><li>Write a <code>setup()</code> function that
		<ol type="a"><li>sizes the screen
				</li><li>sets the <code>background()</code>
				</li><li>sets the initial <code>stroke()</code> color</li></ol>
         </li><li>Write a <code>draw()</code> function and leave it empty for now
         </li><li>Write a <code>keyPressed()</code> function with the following <code>if</code> statements
               <ol type="a"><li>if the key pressed means left
                     <ol type="i"> <li>decrease the X coordinate by one 
						</li><li>draw a point at the current coordinates</li></ol>
               </li><li>if the key pressed means right
                     <ol type="i"> <li>increase the X coordinate by one 
						</li><li>draw a point at the current coordinates</li></ol>
               </li><li>if the key pressed means up
                     <ol type="i"> <li>decrease the Y coordinate by one 
						</li><li>draw a point at the current coordinates</li></ol>
               </li><li>if the key pressed means down
                     <ol type="i"> <li>increase the Y coordinate by one 
						</li><li>draw a point at the current coordinates</li></ol>
        </li></ol></li></ol>

<h3>Step Two:</h3>
Once you have the basic program working you can add features and graphics to make your program more interesting.
Have fun and be creative! Your etch-a-sketch doesn't have to look like any other.
